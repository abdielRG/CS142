/*
	Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south,
	and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the 
	primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 services I-5, and I-290 services I-90.
	
	Note: 200 is not a valid auxiliary highway because 00 is not a valid primary highway number.

	Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, indicate what 
	primary highway it serves. Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.

	Ex: If the input is:
		90
	the output is:
		I-90 is primary, going east/west.

	Ex: If the input is:
		290
	the output is:
		I-290 is auxiliary, serving I-90, going east/west.

	Ex: If the input is:
		0
	or any number not between 1 and 999, the output is:
		0 is not a valid interstate highway number.

	Ex: If the input is:
		200
	the output is:
		200 is not a valid interstate highway number.
