/*
24-hour time (also known in the U.S. as military time) is widely used around the world. 
Time is expressed as hours since midnight. The day starts at 00:00, and ends at 23:59. 
Write a program that converts am/pm time to 24-hour time. The input is two numbers and a string. 
If the input is 2 30 pm, the output should be 14:30. If the input is 12 01 am, the output should be 00:01.

Hints:

    Think of how each hour should be handled. 12 00 am -12 59 am becomes what? 8 00 am becomes what? 12 00 pm? 
    1 00 pm? Group the hours into cases that should be handled similarly (e.g., 1 00 am to 11 00 am are handled the same).

    Declare variables for hoursAmPm, minAmPm, and hours24. Note that minutes for 24-hour time remain the same 
    as for am/pm, so no extra variable is needed.

    Use an if-else statement to detect each case, and set the hours24 appropriately.

    When outputting hour24, check if the hour is 0-9 (just check for < 10). If so, output a "0". 
    So 7 will be output as 07. Do the same when outputting the minutes.
