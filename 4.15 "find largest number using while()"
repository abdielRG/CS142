/*
Write a program that repeatedly reads in integers until a negative integer is read. The program also keeps track of the largest integer that has been read so far and outputs the largest integer at the end.

Ex: If the input is:
    2 77 17 4 -1
the output is:
    77

Assume a user will enter at least one non-negative integer.
