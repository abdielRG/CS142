/*
	Given four values representing counts of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies, output the total amount as dollars and cents.

	Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
		System.out.printf("Amount: $%.2f\n", dollars);

	Ex: If the input is:
		4 3 2 1
	where 4 is the number of quarters, 3 is the number of dimes,
	2 is the number of nickels, and 1 is the number of pennies, the output is:
		Amount: $1.41
	
	For simplicity, assume input is non-negative.
